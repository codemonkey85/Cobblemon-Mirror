/**
 * Something that contributes to the construction of an entity's brain. Implementations are expected to make
 * their changes using the provided [BrainConfigurationContext] which helps stage the details of the entity's
 * brain before locking into the highly immutable structure that Mojang uses.
 *
 * A brain config has access to the [LivingEntity] it's for but note that this is, in most cases, an extremely
 * young version of the entity that is not fully initialized and might die if you try getting exotic with it.
