/**
 * A [PosableState] that exists even without an entity or age-based state. This is
 * for when a Pok√©mon needs to be continuously animated from GUIs and there isn't an entity
 * to attach state to. It has no age, and updating the partial ticks will increment rather
 * than replace.
 *
 * What to look out for: Don't run updatePartialTicks multiple times in a single frame. For
 * other [PosableState] this is fine as it just replaces what was there before, but
 * since this is incremental it would actually mess up the animation speeds.
